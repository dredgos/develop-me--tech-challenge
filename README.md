# Ping Pong Tournament

Welcome to Microsoft's newest (unofficial & unendorsed) addition to the MS office suite - MS Tournament (ping pong edition)! 

Check it out here: https://dredgos.github.io/develop-me--tech-challenge/

This app allows users to add names to the competitors list and when the total competitors is a power of 2 and greater than 4 it will generate a tournament bracket. Each game can have a winner selected and once all games are locked in the tournament shows the next round of games, this sequence continues until there is a tournament winner.

The app was created using React, Redux and styled using SASS.
